# geospatial-data-project

## INTRODUCTION

#### The project consists in getting through a provided database, getting the necessary data to find out which is the perfect location for the company you work for. The database provides different information about some companies, either, income, their location or where they have their different offices. Thanks to these data I have been able to draw different conclusions. 

## PROCESS
### 1ยบ Cleaning the DataSet in MongoDB Compass

### 2ยบ Final DataFrame with Warsaw companies (with a final map of the whole city)

### 3ยบ Foursquare 
#### Getting Foursquare's API in order to get the location of the different places in Warsaw such as pubs, sports centers or restaurants.

### 4ยบ Final Map
#### Join in a DataFrame the different companies of Warsaw with all the chosen queries, for example: basketball stadiums, bars and Starbucks and generate a joint map with all.
